If we are a trying to determine what contributes to the price of a listing, the length of time it's on market likely does not have an effect on listing price (we wouldn't expect our unsuccessful owners to raise their price).  In addition, when trying to predict how much money a property will be listed for, we won't know the length of time that listing will end up being on the market.\n",
