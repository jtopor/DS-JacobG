    "Let's see what happens when we bring objects and refactoring into the world of APIs.  It seems like this could make sense.  If we begin to use objects just like we use APIs, we could write code in such a way that are code is more reusable.  As a first step, let's use our list of dictionaries from the API to construct a list of receipt objects.  Let's get started."
